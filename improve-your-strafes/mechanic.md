### MouseSpeed

First, you want to have your strafe speed (the speed at which you move your mouse) close to perfect. You can find a lot of tools like Spicy's [StrafeAnalyzerLoader](https://github.com/spicy/StrafeAnalyzer/releases/download/1.22/StrafeAnalyzerLoader.exe). Explanations for it can be found [HERE](https://github.com/spicy/StrafeAnalyzer/blob/master/README.md).



### Keypresses

you would like the time between turning your mouse and changing keys on the keyboard to be as short as possible. Practice being as synchronized as possible, even if it means being a little slower and making wider strafes at first.
