# ‚Åâ What is "bunnyhop" ?

The principle of bunnyhopping is to **move only by hopping**. The speed increases while the player is **Strafing**.

Strafe-jumping / strafing was the result of a bug in the codebase of the 1996 first-person shooter **Quake**, but it was later decided to be left intact as it had become a standard technique used by the players. The bug itself relies on math: by pressing a directional key (left or right), the game adds a unit vector in that direction to the player's movement speed. The final sum (plus lead side), however, is never normalized

**Basically, it's a move method that was originally a bug. It consists of jumping and moving in the air to gain speed.**
