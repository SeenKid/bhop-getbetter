# Softwares

Smooths mouse movement over multiple frames. This is the most important program to maximize your gain potential : [**RawInput2.exe**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125989208985702450/1125991462430048256/RawInput2.exe)

No delay for jumping, the higher the ping on a sever you play on, the more delay there would be on your jumping unless you use this program : [**BunnyhopAPE.zip**](https://github.com/log-ical/BunnyhopAPE/releases/download/1.1/BunnyhopAPE.zip)\


Anti-W nulls (for not overlapping keys, disables w when pressing space). Having it disable W right out of your pre can help you gain speed on your second jump, because if you are letting go of W even slightly too late, for a moment you are technically doing half-sideways in the deadzone so you will not be gaining speed in the beginning (which is also the most important part of any jump as you have the most speed gain potential in your second jump) : [**nulls.cfg**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125989208985702450/1125991636451725312/nulls.cfg)
