# ðŸ¦œ Reduce lags on bhop servers

If you have lags on your favorite bhop server (feeling stuck to the ground when you jump), you can try this.\
\
1\. go back to your **game properties, launch options** and **write -insecure**\
2\. **Download** [**BunnyhopAPE**](https://github.com/log-ical/BunnyhopAPE/releases/download/1.1/BunnyhopAPE.zip)**.**\
3\. Launch your game and [BunnyhopAPE](https://github.com/log-ical/BunnyhopAPE/releases/download/1.1/BunnyhopAPE.zip), and **enable it.**\
4\. Connect to your favorite server. You shouldn't feel lags anymore.



This is how it looks :tada:
